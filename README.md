# SunmiNotes Pro


This is a "Pro" version of my Notepad-like program SunmiNotes written in C#. It's pretty barebone at the moment and it's made using a tutorial because I'm just learning and trying C# so expect bugs.

Compared to SunmiNotes it has following new features:

- Many more text formatting options including fonts
- Quicker start
- Basic icons for save, copy and more functions
- C# Files(.cs) support
- Visual Basic Files(.vb) support

Similar to SunmiNotes it also has following features:

- Text Files(.txt) support
- Sunmi Documents format(.sunmi) support
- Python Scripts format(.py) support
